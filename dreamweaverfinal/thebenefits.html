        <h2>The Benefits of Dual Citizenship</h2>

      <h3>Having full rights of each country's citizens</h3>
        
        <p>Being a dual citizen of the USA and Philippines allows you excercise full rights of 
        countries. You can even vote in either presedential election without conflict. Also,
        incase of a big emergency you can call either consulate for assistance.</p>
        
        <h3>Owning land</h3>
        
        <p>Unless you're a filipino national, trying to own land can be a hassle, if not impossible. 
        The route many foreigners take when trying to own land in the Philippines is through marriage, 
        condo's, or partial ownership.</p>
        
      <h3>Choose which passport to use</h3>
        
        <p>Depending on the countries you decide to travel to, you are able to use either passport
        that is more efficient and beneficial. Country relations are a big thing. The decision on 
        whether to use a US or Philippine passport could allow for avoiding negative bias, visa, and
        overall access to the designated coutry. Similar to the European Union, the Philippines is 
        part of the Asean nations. This makes traveling to any country part of the Asean nations a 
        breeze.</p>
        
        <h3>Unlimited time to stay and no visa's required</h3>
        
        <p>You can stay as long as you want in either places without having to fill out any paperwork
        for visa applications</p>
        
        <h3>Taxation</h3>
        
        <p>Although, no matter what country you travel to as a US citizen, you will still be required
        to file taxes for all income. In the past the Philippines had that as a requirment but not anymore.
        which is good because there won't be dual taxation</p>
        
        <h3>Philippine Citizenship can be passed down</h3>
        
        <p>This was one misunderstanding I had. I always thought the country you were born in is the citizenship
        you'd be given. It wasn't until recently that I found out different countrys have different citizenship
        laws. The two main forms of citizenship are by land or by blood. The Philippines grants citizenship by blood.
        Many foreigners make the big mistake of having a kid in another coutry thinking they'd automatically
        get citizenship in their birth place. They later are charged a big fee for overstaying illegally in the
        country when they try to leave back to the coutry of origin.</p>
        
        <h3>Owning a business</h3>
        
        <p>Compared to the US, the Philippines is a pretty affordable place to live. The great benefit of dual 
            citizenship here is being able to offshore a busness that's fully in your name. The cost of labor 
            and resources are cheaper too.</p>
        
        <h3>Employment</h3>
        
        <p>As an American and Filipino my plan is to get a remote job here in the US and live in the Philippines.
        It'll allow me to live comfortably while being able to save quicker...which means more world travel.
        Getting a job in the Philippines is also an option. I would be able to avoid applying for sponsors or a work
        visa.</p>
