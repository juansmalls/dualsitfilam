        <p>Being born in the United States I grew up thinking the only citizenship
        I'd ever be able to benefit from would be US. Born to an American father and a Filipino 
        mother, caused my curiousity to gradually grow more over time with the thought of 
        potentially creating my own little place to hide from the world from time to time.</p>

        <p>Like many, I was unaware of dual citizenship being an option. Here I will discuss why 
        you should get dual citizenship and the procedure on aquiring US and Filipino dual  
        citizenship.</p>
